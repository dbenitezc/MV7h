# Class Activity 2 Instructions

Based on the integration testing example reviewed in class, extend it by implementing the following features:

1. **Data cleanup:** All data added to the system during test execution must be deleted afterward (only the data added by the tests). Additionally, the tests must verify that the data has been properly deleted. This behavior must be implemented in both the **BackEnd** and **FrontEnd**.

2. **Automatic PDF report generation:** The test results must be automatically saved in a PDF file generated by the system. Each report must have a sequential number and must not overwrite previous reports â€” all previously generated PDFs must be preserved.

## Submission Instructions

This activity must be submitted **individually** through this GitHub repository, inside the `Class_Activity_2` folder. Each student must create a subfolder named with their **ID number**, following the same format used in Lab 1.

Each student is responsible for:
- Merging their **pull request**.
- Ensuring that **no files from other students are deleted**.

## Submission Contents

- Updated code with the requested and test modifications.
- A `README.md` file containing a brief report of the results, indicating which sections of the code were added.

## Deadline

**Saturday, June 21**
